If you like you can become a beta tester. That way you get the app release a bit sooner (and often
more frequently) so that you can evaluate the latest changes and provide feedback on discoverd issues.

## Coming features

* OK - There are INPUT value and OUTPUT values, very simple
* OK - have dark and light theme in app (test, should be provided by theme)
* One of the input that could be on a seperate page is the efficiency ( consumption in Wh vs speed)
* I like the fact that there are colours approaching green above and below the optimum speed so people can see how it compare to the speed below and above
* I also thought about a correction factor based on a % of the best average speed to use vs the real speed average that the trip was so if there is a difference of value vs what people really had they could just adjust the correction factor the value for the next trips for the best average speed to use.
* allow for imperial units also from app settings

## TODO

* release iOS version of this app
* create some donation option
* have input masks and input validation
* remove obfuscation from release app
* remove calculate button completely and instead monitor changes?
* fix small screen support
