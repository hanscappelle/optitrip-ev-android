## About the App

This app calcualtes the optimal ride speed for EV given known consumption vales. Based on
OPTITRIP EV v1.4 spreadsheet created by Stephane Melan√ßon aka DOCTORBASS 2018

## Coming features

* There are INPUT value and OUTPUT values, very simple
* One of the input that could be on a seperate page is the efficiency ( consumption in Wh vs speed. People could test  and input value for 10kmh, 20kmh 30kmh etc up to 120kmh and get a graph and the calculation of the optimum speed would be based on it.
* I like the fact that there are colours approaching green above and below the optimum speed so people can see how it compare to the speed below and above
* I also thought about a correction factor based on a % of the best average speed to use vs the real speed average that the trip was so if there is a difference of value vs what people really had they could just adjust the correction factor the value for the next trips for the best average speed to use.
