## About the App

This app calculates the optimal ride speed for EV given known consumption vales. Based on
OPTITRIP EV v1.4 spreadsheet created by Stephane Melan√ßon aka DOCTORBASS 2018

## Where to get the app

For stable release version see Google play store on your device or use link below

[play store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.hcpl.android.optitripev)

If you like you can become a beta tester. That way you get the app release a bit sooner (and often
more frequently) so that you can evaluate the latest changes and provide feedback on discoverd issues.

## Bugs & Upcoming features

* Add a correction factor (%) of the best average speed to use vs the real speed average a trip was. 
  So if there is a difference of value vs what people really had they could just adjust that way.
* allow calculation of consumption numbers from coefficient (just 2 inputs needed)
* create donation option on about screen
* input validation with error message per field

## Dev Notes

Everything is stored locally in preferences (private to app). Results are all stored in Metric, 
so when Imperial is selected the conversion is done both on storing input and display of output.

A default set of speed/consumption values in known in the app to recover to defaults.
This is the information based on the original excel. Note that these are motorcycle
numbers. Nothing stops you from changing the defaults to use for cars or anything else.

Moved repo from bitbucket to github, links in readme changed.
